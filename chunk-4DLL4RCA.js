This method involves placing a pre-measured amount of material, typically in the form of a rubber compound or thermosetting plastic, into a heated mold cavity. The mold is then closed, and pressure is applied to shape the material into the desired form. The heat causes the material to cure or harden, solidifying the part into its final shape.","link","/services/rubber-molding/compression-molding"],["title","Transfer Molding","learnText","Learn more about Transfer Molding","imageUrl","/assets/services/rubber-molding/molding-processes/transfer-molding/transferMolding.jpg","description","Transfer molding is a versatile manufacturing process that combines elements of both injection molding and compression molding to produce high-quality, detailed, and high-strength components.

                We maufacturer o rings per many industry standards with the most common being AS568. We have existing family tooling for many common sizes. 
                We make o rings from many materials including VMQ (Silicone), FVMQ (Fluorosilicone), FKM (Viton), NBR, HNBR, EPDM, and many more.
                We have a visual inspection system that is able to inspect every part from 7 different angles, including from below through a high quality glass table. 
                We inspect flash, cross section, diameters, as well as look for visual issues like non fills, inclusion of foreign materials, uncured spots and more in 100% of the parts we make up to 80mm in diameter. 
                This system automatically sorts out the parts out of spec and ensures that 100% of the parts we ship to our customers meet the requirements.
                We have hundreds of existing compounds with testing data so in most cases we can reference our test bank to choose a compound that meets the customer's requirements without additional testing. 
                We compound all of these rubbers in house, and stock raw material for quick turn arounds.
