                            We have advanced rheometers at our disposal, enabling us to thoroughly review the cure profile of our rubber compounds throughout both the compound development phase and as a final quality check during production. 
                            This ensures that each lot meets the exacting standards established for the compoundâ€™s performance. 
                            With this capability, we can quickly develop compounds internally and perform a comprehensive 100% lot check in production, guaranteeing that every material batch will perform as intended.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our Montech rheometer plays a crucial role in this process by enabling us to accurately measure and analyze the flow properties of materials. 
                            This device helps us evaluate critical parameters such as viscosity, curing characteristics, and other essential properties that directly impact product performance. 
                            Through precise measurement and analysis, we ensure optimal formulation and processing of polymers and other compounds, delivering reliable, high-performing products to our customers.

                        We have the top of the line visual inspection system from Keyence for quickly and accurately taking measurements of small to medium sized parts. 
                        1 or many parts are placed onto the glass table and the system analyses the parts in a matter of seconds. 
                        We are able to take 10s of measurements on 10s of parts in seconds with this special equipment.
                        We also have the capability to take thickness/height measurements using either a low force or non contact probe. 
                        This tool is used for initial production runs, PPAP measurements, internal checkoffs to start production, measurements of small mold inserts, and AQL measurements for some production parts when we are not able to do a 100% inspection on our Doss Visual Inspection system.

                                    Not only can we use this cutting edge technology to quickly and accurately take measurements of molded parts, but we also use it for measurements of mold components. 
                                    We can take many measurements in a matter of seconds for critical components of molds to ensure that all dimensions are in specification before molding parts to save time, and ensure molds are made to specification the first time.

                        We use AI and special algorithms to detect for non fills in the part, cuts, measure flash, and take critical measurements. 
                        The parts with dimensional or cosmetic issues are automatically sorted from the good parts using a compressed air sorting system in this system. 
                        All of the test data is saved in a database and statistical reports are automatically generated. We can supply CPK, other reports, and even all of the dimensional measurements for millions of parts if desired.
