                        Rubber Compounding is the process of mixing raw rubber with various additives to create a custom material with specific properties like strength, flexibility, or heat resistance. 
                        By carefully selecting and combining elastomers, curing agents, and fillers, we produce high-performance compounds tailored to meet the unique needs of your application.

                            We are one of the largest compounders and molders of silicone rubber in North America. 
                            The majority of our silicone rubber compounds use a speciality platinum addition cure system that we formulate internally. 
                            This cure system is typically reserved for medical applications because it typically adds a lot of cost when compared to the typical peroxide cure system. 
                            Since we are vertically integrating formulating the cure system internally and we have the scale that we do we can use this cure system without additional costs when compared to peroxide cure systems. 
                            Because of our special cure system and formulation in our compounds we can have much better physical properties than standard silicone compounds. 
                            It is common for our compounds to have double the tear strength and 25%+ higher tensile strength than standard peroxide compounds.

                        <p class="mt-3 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">
                            We have double arm sigma mixers and compound silicone from the polymer, which is very uncommon for rubber molders. 
                            We create our own masterbatches for the cure system, pigments, mold release and more all internally which gives us a huge cost advantage, more controlled processes and allows us to perfect our formulations to maximize the efficiency in our molding departments.

                            We can handle high volume production with our banbury mixing compounding line that can handle millions of pounds of rubber per year. 
                            We also have several different sized 2 roll mills to handle the low to medium volume compounding requirements of organic rubbers. 
                            Our team has decades of experience formulating organic rubber compounds. Many times we have a formulation with test results available that meets our customer's requirements without needing to do any additional development work.
