                Rubber molding is a manufacturing process that involves shaping rubber into specific forms using molds. 
                This versatile technique is used to create custom parts for various industries, ensuring precise dimensions, durability, and performance. 
                Ideal for producing seals, gaskets, and other components, rubber molding offers flexibility in design and material choice for a wide range of applications.

            description="Compression molding is an ideal manufacturing process for producing complex, high-volume parts, particularly in industries that require rubber or rubber-like materials. This method involves placing a pre-measured amount of material, typically in the form of a rubber compound or thermosetting plastic, into a heated mold cavity. The mold is then closed, and pressure is applied to shape the material into the desired form. The heat causes the material to cure or harden, solidifying the part into its final shape."

We are one of the largest manufacturers of silicone and fluorosilicone products in North America with hundreds of existing compounds that we have developed over decades. Very few companies have more experience or scale with silicone rubber than us, we cannot be beat with silicone molded products."
