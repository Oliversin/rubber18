                    Because of our scale we have established standardized dimensions and processes for our molds.

                    We also have a full tool crib to go along our CNC department with 37 CNC machines. 
                    We have offline tool setters to ensure precision when making our molds. 
                    We stock a lot of endmills and typically have what we need in stock ready to go to immediately begin cutting a new mold. 
                    We stock lots of metal at our facility from sheet metal to up to 28" thick. 
                    We have the tool steel in stock ready to go for our new projects, we do not have to wait for an external supplier to cut to size and order steel for new projects. 
                    We are one of the largest rubber mold manufacturers in Mexico making hundreds of molds a year, so this scale allows us to provide very economical tooling at industry leading turnarounds.
