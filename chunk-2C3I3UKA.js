                <p> We manufacturer a wide spectrum of FKM lined silicone hoses that comply with SAE J30 R7. We have special formulations and techniques to ensure great adhesion that meets the toughest of requirements. Our FKM lined hoses are autoclave cured, and provide additional impermeation properties that silicone or even fluorosilicone (FVMQ) cannot provide.  </p>
                <p> There are a lot of challenges with making FKM lined silicone hoses, but we have the experience it takes to handle the toughest parts to make. We compound FKM internally and have the scale to provide the most cost effective parts in the market</p>
