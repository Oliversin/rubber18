These machines use vacuum to help eliminate trapped air, and the 3RT system with a shuttle helps automate the process. Complex parts can be molded using these machines using 4+ plates without needing the operators to handle the molds. We also have larger presses that we use for large seals, windows trim seals, floor mats and other large molded parts. Our largest press is 102" x 72" in size and 800T.
