Fluorosilicone is much more impermeable than silicone hoses without a liner. 
                In many applications either the liquid or vapors can permeate through silicone causing sweating and degradation of the hose. 
                Fluorosilicone provides less chemical resistance than FKM, but is more easy to work with to make complicated parts. 
                For most application that need improved chemical resistance than silicone FVMQ is a great option. 
                FVMQ processes similar to silicone meaning that most parts can be used using the same techniques as silicone hoses without liners. 
                When additional chemical resistance is needed that FVMQ cant provide or when the thickness of the liner becomes cost prohibitive we choose an FKM/Viton liner instead.
